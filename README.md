# Product_Analysis_in_E-Commerce
Using a thorough data engineering methodology that combines web scraping, data preparation, and advanced analytics, this research investigates the analysis of e-commerce products. The main goal is to pinpoint important patterns, like the most popular product categories, price alterations, and product ratings. Web scraping is the method used to acquire data; BeautifulSoup is used to retrieve comprehensive product information from the Flipkart platform. This dataset contains ratings, costs, and other pertinent information about the products.
PySpark is used for data preprocessing, which includes cleaning, converting, and enhancing the product dataset, after data gathering. This guarantees that the data is prepared for analysis and has a proper structure. Datasets may be handled well with PySpark's DataFrame feature, facilitating easy data preparation and processing. The project architecture builds a solid data engineering pipeline using Azure services. Azure Data Factory automates the process of ingesting data, which then flows into Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for the storage of raw product data. After that, the raw product data is transformed using Azure Databricks and thoroughly processed and cleaned before being put back into Data Lake Gen 2 and prepared for in-depth analysis.
Large-scale data processing and querying are made possible by the integration of the cleaned and transformed data with Azure Synapse Analytics for analytics. Using Power Bl, the final insights are visualised to produce interactive dashboards with actionable insights on product performance and trends. In addition to facilitating smooth data flow from input to visualisation, this end-to-end data pipeline gives organisations the insights they need to make data-driven choices about product management and marketing.
